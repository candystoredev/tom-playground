# State

## Current Status
Phases 1-4d complete and verified. Tumblr migration has been run — real content is live on dev.thehoecks.com. Seed test data cleaned. Feed shows tag/people links on every post. Filtered pages at `/tags/{slug}`, `/people/{slug}`, `/albums/{slug}` with cursor-based infinite scroll.

## Active Branch
claude/family-photo-album-plan-rEoOE

## Current Task
Phase 4e: Year/month timeline navigation + month pages (oldest-first)

## Blockers
None

## Known Issues
- FTS5 tags field always inserts empty string (trigger doesn't join tag names)

## Next Action
Build Phase 4e (year/month timeline navigation, oldest-first month pages).

## Recent Changes
- Seed data cleaned from dev site (`DELETE /api/seed?clean=all`) — only real migrated content remains
- Clean-all seed endpoint added to remove seed posts, media, tags, people, and albums
- Schema init hardened: tumblr_id index created after migration to avoid conflicts
- Migration script hardened: transactions, slug dedup, seed cleanup
- Tumblr OAuth key renamed to match Vercel env convention
- Tumblr blog ID and family people list configured for migration
- Phase 4d: Tag/people/album filtered pages with cursor-based infinite scroll
- Phase 4d: Feed API extended with filter params, returns tags/people per post
- Phase 4d: Clickable `@person` and `#tag` links in feed
- Phase 4d: Shared `lib/feed.ts` for server-side feed fetching
- Fullscreen lightbox with swipe, keyboard arrows, dot indicators
- iMessage chat bubble on feed posts
- Post detail page simplified to permalink-only (OG tags for link previews)

## AI Guardrails
Assumptions:
- Phases 1-3 are considered complete per ROADMAP.md phase definitions
- Migration script has not been run against real Tumblr data yet
- Dev deployment at dev.thehoecks.com is the primary test target
- Tom is the primary admin user

Constraints:
- All changes must work within Vercel free tier limits
- Media uploads must go through presigned R2 URLs (not through Vercel)
- All passwords must be bcrypt hashed, never plaintext
- Post pages must remain publicly accessible (for OG previews)
- Do not break existing auth flow

Do Not:
- Add new services or paid dependencies without explicit approval
- Change the database schema without updating `schema.ts` and ARCHITECTURE.md
- Modify auth middleware behavior without re-verifying all access paths
- Run the migration script against production without Tom's confirmation
- Remove crawler blocking from post pages
- Store plaintext passwords anywhere
- Add features from the V2 backlog during current phases
