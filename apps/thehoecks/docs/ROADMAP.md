# Roadmap

## Completed

### Phase 1 — Foundation & Schema
- Next.js + Tailwind initialized at `apps/thehoecks/`
- Turso connection + full schema (all tables, FTS5, indexes, sync triggers)
- Seed `site_settings` with defaults (viewer password hash, site title/description, iMessage recipients)
- Auth: shared password login + session cookie middleware + admin bearer token validation
- All routes protected; admin routes gated separately
- Dark theme skeleton layout
- `robots.txt` blocking all crawlers
- Deployed to dev.thehoecks.com
- Verified: dev starts, Turso connects, login works, logout blocks, admin route returns 403 without admin auth, Vercel deploy succeeds

### Phase 2 — First Vertical Slice
- Test media upload to R2 (photo, video, multi-photo)
- Seed posts with R2 key references
- Chronological feed behind auth with dark theme
- Full stack proven end-to-end (Turso → API → R2 media → browser)
- Verified: Login → posts with photos/videos from R2 → dark theme correct on desktop and phone
- Test: Unit tests for slug generation (duplicate titles, untitled fallbacks, date-based slugs, suffix incrementing)

### Phase 3 — Migration Script
- Tumblr API v2 pagination with rate-limit handling
- All post types handled: photo/video → `photo`/`video`/`mixed`; text/quote/link/answer → `text`
- HTML sanitization on captions/bodies
- Media download → R2 upload with thumbnails via `sharp`, video posters via Tumblr poster frames
- People/tag split based on configurable people list
- Slug generation with dedup suffixing
- Photoset layout strings preserved
- File size recorded per media item
- Dry-run mode, offset/limit support, skip-if-already-migrated
- Output summary (counts by type, skipped items with reasons)
- Post-migration: `turso db dump` for baseline backup
- Staged testing: 10 posts → 100 posts → full migration (see ARCHITECTURE.md for details)
- Verified: Post count matches Tumblr, no orphaned media/records, people/tags split correctly, feed renders all content

## In Progress

### Phase 4 — Public Site
Dark theme: same concept as Tumblr, refined/sharper/modern. Mobile-first. Each sub-slice deployed and verified before next.

- **4a** ~~Polished feed + cursor-based infinite scroll~~ — **DONE**
  - Cursor-based pagination with `(date, id)` tiebreaker
  - IntersectionObserver infinite scroll with 600px lookahead
  - SSR first page, client-side subsequent pages via `/api/feed`
  - Edge-to-edge images on mobile, rounded corners on desktop
  - 25-post seed script for testing pagination
- **4b** ~~Post page + OG tags + iMessage button~~ — **DONE**
  - Post page at `/posts/{slug}` with OG tags for link previews
  - iMessage button on every post in feed (pre-filled SMS with post URL)
  - `X-Robots-Tag` + `noindex` on post pages
- **4c** ~~Multi-photo grid/mosaic + lightbox~~ — **DONE**
  - `photoset_layout` grid rendering matching Tumblr layouts
  - Full-screen lightbox with swipe, keyboard arrows, dot indicators
  - Image preloading, backdrop close, body scroll lock
- **4d** ~~Tag, People, Album filtered pages~~ — **DONE**
  - `/tags/{slug}`, `/people/{slug}`, `/albums/{slug}` with cursor-based infinite scroll
  - Feed API extended with `tag`, `person`, `album` filter params
  - Feed shows clickable `@person` and `#tag` links per post
  - Album cover image display
  - Shared `lib/feed.ts` for server-side feed fetching
  - Verify: Click tag → filtered posts only. People page correct. Album cover displays. Pagination works within filters
- **4e**: Year/month timeline navigation + month pages (oldest-first)
  - Verify: Navigate to month → oldest-first order. Pagination walks forward. No empty months shown
- **4f**: FTS5 search with highlighted results
  - Verify: Search "birthday" → finds birthday posts. Search person name → finds their posts. Empty search handled
  - Test: Automated FTS5 test (insert posts, verify search results and ranking)
- **4g**: Crawler blocking hardening (`noindex` meta, `X-Robots-Tag` header)
  - Verify: `curl -H "User-Agent: Googlebot"` → response contains `noindex` meta + `X-Robots-Tag` header. OG tags still work

### Phase 5 — Admin Panel & Settings
Responsive web throughout (not PWA). Each sub-slice builds on previous.

- **5a**: Single photo upload (presigned URL → R2 → server thumbnail via `sharp` → DB)
  - Verify: Upload photo → appears in feed with thumbnail. Check R2 bucket for both `original.jpg` and `thumb.jpg`
- **5b**: Full upload form (multi-file, title, date, tags, people, albums, drag-reorder, video poster capture via canvas)
  - Verify: 4-photo post with tags/people → grid + tag/people links. Video → poster frame + playback. Drag-reorder works
- **5c**: Edit + delete posts (with R2 cleanup)
  - Verify: Edit title → updated in feed + post page. Add photo → grid updates. Delete post → gone from feed + R2 cleaned
- **5d**: Settings page (change viewer password, manage invite links, update iMessage numbers, edit site metadata)
  - Verify: Change password → old fails, new works. Create invite → incognito auto-auth. Revoke → rejected. Update iMessage → reflected
  - Test: Automated auth middleware tests (viewer JWT blocked from admin, expired/revoked invites rejected, valid invite sets cookie)
- **5e**: Tech stack overview page — at-a-glance view of infrastructure (Vercel, Turso, R2, Doppler, domain/DNS)
- **5f**: Changelog — track what's been built and when, visible from admin UI
- **5g**: Admin tabs — separate tabs for Settings, Tech Stack, Changelog

### Phase 6 — iOS Shortcut
- Shortcut definition + setup guide
- Uses ADMIN_API_TOKEN (iOS Keychain)
- Supports: single photo, multi-photo, video, mixed
- Flow: Select photos → Share → fill title/tags → presigned upload to R2 → `POST /api/posts` → server thumbnail
- EXIF date extraction → pre-fill post date
- Continues in background if user switches apps
- Verify: On iPhone — select 3 photos → share → shortcut → fill title/tags → post appears on dev.thehoecks.com with thumbnails, tags, EXIF date

### Phase 7 — Performance & Polish
- Performance optimization with real content (no visual redesign — styling done in Phase 4)
- Loading states and perceived performance
- Cross-browser/mobile testing (Safari, Chrome, Firefox — desktop and phone)
- Accessibility pass (keyboard nav, screen reader, color contrast)
- Verify: Lighthouse performance score. Feed loads quickly on throttled mobile. All elements keyboard-accessible. No layout shifts

### Phase 8 — Go Live
- Final review of all content on dev.thehoecks.com
- DNS update: thehoecks.com → Vercel production
- Merge to master → auto-deploy
- Verify: Production end-to-end (login → feed → post → iMessage → search)
- Share invite links with family

## Backlog (V2 — Post-Launch)

Schema can accommodate all V2 features without breaking changes.

### Category Management
- Tag display names (e.g., "perform" → "Performances"), descriptions, custom sort order
- People profiles (display name, `profile_photo_r2_key`, description, sort order)
- Album custom sort order

### Admin Enhancements
- Change admin password from settings (v1: env var only)
- Default tags/people quick-pick lists for upload form
- Posts-per-page tuning
- Site banner image upload
- Bulk operations (multi-select posts for tag/album assignment)

### Content Features
- "On this day" — surface posts from same date in past years
- Favorites / pinned posts
- Download original photo button
- Print-friendly view

### Search & Discovery
- Search by date range
- Filter by multiple tags/people simultaneously
- "Related posts" suggestions

### Media
- Video thumbnail frame picker (v1: auto poster frame)
- Multiple thumbnail sizes (feed vs. lightbox vs. OG) — R2 key convention supports this (`media/{id}/thumb_lg.{ext}`, etc.)
- HEIC → JPEG conversion on upload

### Analytics (Lightweight)
- Most-viewed posts (simple counter, no third-party tracking)
- Invite link usage stats

### Infrastructure
- Automated backup schedule (cron → `turso db dump` → R2)
- Staging environment

## Testing Strategy

**Automated tests** (written as they come up):
- Slug generation (duplicates, untitled fallbacks, suffix logic)
- Cursor-based pagination (ordering, tiebreakers, no skips/dupes)
- Auth middleware (viewer can't reach admin, expired invite rejected, valid invite sets cookie)
- FTS5 search (insert posts, verify results match)

**Manual verification**: Against dev.thehoecks.com on desktop and phone.

Each phase has a verify checklist — phase isn't done until every item passes.
